1 Nephi |1|1|1| I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, 
therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; 
and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, 
nevertheless, 
having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days;
yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God,
therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

Moses |1||1||3|

|1| The words of God, which he spake unto Moses at a time when Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high mountain,

|2| And he saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses; therefore Moses could endure his presence.

|3| And God spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless?
